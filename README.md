# Simple Neural Network on CSV File in Tensorflow 2.0

This repo shows how to use Tensorflow 2.0 to build and predict Fahrenheit temperatures based on values in Celsius. The file 'data.csv' contains 3 columns representing temperatures from the planets Mars, Jupiter and Venus. 

The values for the temperatures in this dataset were created using `np.random.rand`, so these aren't real temperatures.
